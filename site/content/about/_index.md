title: A new way to discover
subtitle: ' DNA sequencing costs are dropping exponentially, and DNA synthesis costs are not far behind.'
intro: >-
  These technologies are enabling genome sequencing and engineering at an
  unprecedented scale. Many of the world's most important medicines are derived from
  nature, found by accident without knowledge of the source DNA sequence. We start from genomic data, then use our advanced software to identify, prioritize, and generate variants of the most promising molecules for testing.
approach:
  main: Our Unique Approach
  intro: >-
    Our proprietary methods allow us to develop medicines against novel
    targets, even targets previously considered undruggable. Our focus is on
    oncology and anti-infective medicines.
  heading: Why fungi?
  text: >-
    Fungi are similar to humans, sharing 6000 genes, all of which are potential therapeutic targets. Fungi have evolved medicines for human proteins over billions on years. And while over 5 million fungi exist on Earth, only a few thousand species have been studied to date.

      The TICker algorithm can identify human targets of cryptic natural
      products, prioritizing among thousands of candidates.
