  heading: Finding Small Molecules to Treat Disease
  text: >-
    We know many of the proteins that drive illnesses like cancer, but most are
    considered “undruggable” by experts. However, small molecules have evolved
    in several other species to target these proteins. Now, we have a way to
    find them and develop them into medicines.
